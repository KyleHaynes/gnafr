#' Load GNAF CSV data into the database
#'
#' Uses DuckDB's native CSV reader for maximum speed. The GNAF CSV must contain
#' at minimum the columns produced by the standard GNAF Core download. All
#' GNAF Core columns are captured, including \code{DATE_CREATED},
#' \code{LEGAL_PARCEL_ID}, \code{MB_CODE}, \code{ALIAS_PRINCIPAL},
#' \code{PRINCIPAL_PID} (alias-to-principal address mapping), and
#' \code{PRIMARY_SECONDARY} / \code{PRIMARY_PID} (main-dwelling vs.
#' sub-dwelling mapping), stored as \code{alias_principal}, \code{principal_pid},
#' \code{primary_secondary} and \code{primary_pid}.
#'
#' The complete CSV batch, locality index and match cache are updated in one
#' transaction. If a file fails to load, the previous database contents remain.
#'
#' @param con DBI connection from \code{gnaf_connect}.
#' @param path Character vector of one or more paths to GNAF CSV files.
#' @param overwrite If \code{TRUE}, deletes existing GNAF rows before loading.
#' @return Invisibly, the total number of GNAF rows now in the database.
#' @export
